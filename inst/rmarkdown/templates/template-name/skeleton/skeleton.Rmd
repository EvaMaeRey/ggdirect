## Adding an RMarkdown Template

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.

This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.

Finally, be sure to remove this message!

`r chunk_reveal("prep_data")`

```{r prep_data, include = F}
Titanic %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  uncount(Freq) %>% 
  sample_frac(1, replace = F) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() -> 
tidy_titanic  
```

  aes(x = survived) + 
  aes(color = sex) + 
  geom_text_count_percent(nudge_y = 10) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")
